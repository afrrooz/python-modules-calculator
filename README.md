# python-modules-calculator
A simple Python calculator project built using custom modules. Demonstrates modular programming, error handling, and user interaction with a menu-driven interface.

# ðŸ§® Python Calculator (Modules Practice)

This is a simple Python project that demonstrates **creating and using custom modules** in Python.  
The project is split into two files:
- `calculator.py` â†’ contains arithmetic functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
- `main.py` â†’ interactive program that imports and uses the module.

## âœ¨ Features
- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division
- Prevents division by zero
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully
- Continuous calculations until the user chooses to exit
- Demonstrates **modular programming** in Python
